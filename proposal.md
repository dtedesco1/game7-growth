## Post-Hype Growth Pilot Proposal

Daniel Tedesco, 2023-01


### Executive Summary

We propose a 12-week pilot program to address the need for a new paradigm for sustainable blockchain game growth. Through a combination of community discussions, expert deep dives, and an actionable playbook, we aim to help thousands of developers navigate the post-hype 2023 environment and avoid the mistakes of the past. Led by a team with a proven track record in global growth and marketing strategies, we will establish Game7 as the go-to community for blockchain gaming growth and drive engagement within the community. Our budget of $28k is structured with milestones to ensure delivery of measurable results.


### Background

The blockchain game developer community is hurting. Many lessons have been learned from the crashes and hacks of 2022, but gamer sentiment remains low. If Game7’s community of developers use the same growth tactics and attract the same players as the 2021 wave of games, they are unlikely to find much sustainable success or win the hearts of mainstream gamers.

Figuring out how growth and marketing will work for blockchain games is critical (30–40% of a mobile game’s revenue today is typically spent on marketing, for example) and no one really knows how to do it. Channels are all different (i.e. lots of restrictions on Google) and new opportunities exist (i.e. airdrops) that don’t yet have best practices.

A new paradigm is needed for sustainable growth. But how does that work? What can be learned from premium game and F2P growth strategies? What launch strategies can blockchain game developers take to avoid spiraling into Ponzi mechanics? Who and where are the players blockchain games should be attracting? How should liveops balance fiat versus crypto monetization, and on-chain versus off-chain rewards?

This documents a pilot program to deeply explore those issues as a community and come up with actionable solutions that will allow the game launches coming in 2023 and beyond to avoid the mistakes of 2021.


### Proposed Solution

A 12-week pilot program publicly driving forum discussion amongst the community, recording deep dives on growth topics with experts, and delivering an immediately actionable playbook for blockchain game devs. 


#### Key Objectives



* Thousands of blockchain game developers gain a clear perspective on sustainable growth strategies in the post-hype 2023 environment.
* Game7 strongly established as the best community for questions and research on blockchain gaming growth strategies
* Game7 community members are engaging and eager to engage more in community discussions on growth, meeting and learning from each other.


#### Budget

$28k. Deliver $7k upon each completion of 4 milestones.


### Milestones


#### 1. Week 1-3:  Solicit questions and speakers via the Discord, forum, and one-on-one outreach. Deliverables:  



* Receive 7 high quality responses on Game7 forum to generate key questions and speaker recommendations
* Roundtable content divided into three key topic areas, speaker invite list drafted and initial invites sent.
* Develop brand materials for the series (YT thumbnail, boilerplate copy, etc.)
* Establish Game7 YouTube channel and podcast feed


#### 2. Week 3-6:  Host first roundtable of 3-4 expert speakers. Deliverables:



* Organize and record roundtable
* Edit and upload event recording
* Publish social media posts
* Foster discussion and feedback on the forum and in Discord to generate new points of view
* Deliver post-event results report


#### 3. Week 6-9:  Host next 2 roundtables. Deliverables:



* Same as previous, but complete everything for two roundtables instead of one


#### 4. Week 9-12:  Draft and launch game growth playbook. Deliverables:



* Summarize key insights from roundtables into a "Blockchain Game Growth 2.0" playbook
* Press release and social media posts
* Deliver review and explore extension as a regular series, expanding to education, community spotlights, and regular how-tos


### Daniel’s Background

I’ve been advising top F2P game developers on growth at Google for nearly half a decade. I develop regular analysis and insights to advise my clients on their growth strategies, and have helped them create billions of dollars of value and earn billions of users. My entry into blockchain began in 2017, and I’ve been actively developing content as co-host of the [Web3 Community Service Hour](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ta_6tSCGfC31iIfhz4bfC_oBKyNZGEdDsZkD-BRXY_Y/edit#) (over 60 live streamed episodes, tens of thousands of views across YT and TikTok). I’ve organized dozens of online roundtable discussions with hundreds of live attendees and strong positive feedback, including roundtables on various web3 topics, but I unfortunately can’t share them outside of Google. With relevant experience and past successes, I'm confident to deliver outsized results and work my butt off to make this a great success for Game7 and the broader blockchain game dev community.
